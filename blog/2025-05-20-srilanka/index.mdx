Sri Lanka is an island south of India referred to as the "__pearl of the indian ocean__". The island is packed with a vibrant culture, lush jungles, sandy beaches, interesting wildlife, great food, ancient temples, and hospitable and friendly people. From the busy streets to the calm and isolated back-roads, there is so much to explore.

## General

**Climate**: 

- Sri Lanka is located approximately 350 - 645 km north of the equator placing it firmly in the tropics, with coastlines experiencing around 25¬∞-35¬∞C and inline highlands somewhat cooler at 15¬∞-18¬∞C. 
- Due to the countries size and location, different areas of the country experience monsoons at different times throughout the year. So if you're wanting something specific on your trip, make sure to plan accordingly. 
- **November** ‚Üí **March** is typically monsoon season in the north and north east, and dry weather in the south and south west coast. **April** ‚Üí **September** is then the reverse.

</details> */}

**Hygiene**:

- Tap water is not drinkable. Drink only bottled water. Also check if the cap on the bottle you receive is sealed, and not already broken. If you expect a drink to come with ice, clarify what water the ice is made with. 
- Check your local countries vaccine recommendations when traveling. Sri Lanka has many mosquitos, particularly in the humid regions inland and around areas with sitting water such as rice fields. 
- Sun cream and (tropical) mosquito spray is a must.
- There are many wild dogs in Sri Lanka on the streets. As much as we love a good doggo, don't approach them.


**Language**: Sri Lanka has two main languages; Sinhala and Tamil. 
- Sinhala, (spoken by Sinhalese people) is most prevalent in the central, west, and south of Sri Lanka. 
- Tamil, (spoken by Tamils) is dominant in the north and east. 

Throughout Sri Lanka all road signs, busses, tourist information, and other infrastructure organizations will features both languages. The main foreign language is English. Although, do not expect that every local will speak english, most do not.

## The South West Route

Unless you've got a specific location in mind, the season your traveling will likely influence your route in Sri Lanka. Our trip was one of the more popular travel routes for shorter periods that goes around the mountain range in the central south and back up to Colombo along the south western coastline.

## Gear Check

### Backpack

If you're traveling around from place to place, even at ease with taxi's or trains, I would wholly recommend taking a backpack instead of a suitcase. Even in busses, they will utilize every space (and I mean every space), so if you've got a bulky suitcase that needs to be wheeled or carried, you're going to find it hard to find a suitable spot.

Chances are, you will also (at some point) have to take some back-road that a car simply can not accommodate. In this case, you'll be taking a tuk tuk, or even walking. You really do not want to be caught out rolling a suitcase through some dirt tracks making an ungodly amount of noise whilst simultaneously ruining the wheels of your suitcase. 

If you're carrying expensive camera gear, then the vibrations of the uneven surfaces will likely not do much good. 
A backpack is simply easier to transport is these conditions, and gives you much more opportunity to organize your equipment, and be more 

I brought two backpacks for the trip: a **travel pack**, and a **day pack**. 

### Drone Regulations 

To bring your drone through customs and have **permission** to fly the drone in the country, your drone has to be registered through the Sri Lanka Aviation Authorities. Luckily, this process is simple and transparent on their website. For me it was a 1-day turnaround from submission to approval for a DJI Mini Pro 4. 

A few remarks regarding drone photography and certain locations. These were earmarked on my application (see below): 

- **Ella:** "*You are not permitted to operate the drone underneath
the Nine Arch Bridge due to provocation of Wasp."*
- **Kandy:** "*You are not permitted to operate the drone over
Temple of the Tooth Relic Premises*".

<details>
    <summary>
    **More Info:** Step-by-step Drone Application
    </summary>
    1) Visit the caa.lk website and start the application  üåê https://portal.caa.lk/drone/apply-now/report.php. 
    2) Information to have handy are your drone ID / license, insurance, along with a general idea of all the places you'll want to fly the drone in addition to your address during this time.
    3) If you're backpacking like we were, I just filled in each of the planned locations we had already booked. For the flight time of the drone (i.e., when you'll be operating), I entered normal day-time hours e.g., 8:00 - 19:00. Obviously, unless you have a planned shoot, this is hard to fill in.   
    4) Receive confirmation email - You'll get a tracking ID and notification of how long the process will take.
    5) The application will be passed on to security clearance, where you'll also be cc'd.  
    6) Receive email to make the application **payment**. 
</details>

### Clothing

 Sri Lanka's tropical climate means bringing clothes for hot and humid weather. Anything breathable is perfect. Here are some essentials:
- Have one good ***fleece*** for evenings and mornings for the inland weather, where temperatures are somewhat cooler. 
- I'd recommend a ***raincoat*** even if you're traveling in the dry season. Torrential downpours can occur within a minute, and last as quickly as 5 minutes. 
- Your footwear depends on what activities you're going to be doing. However, some ***study walking shoes*** and a pair of ***flip flops*** are a must.

## Means of Travel 

### Tuk Tuk

 The most convenient way to get around in Sri Lanka is, by far, using a Tuk Tuk. If you're not familiar, Tuk Tuk's (Sinhalese for the general *auto rickshaw*) are small three-wheelers that are available to rent or hire as a taxi service. The engines are mostly 4-stroke (older models were previously 2-stroke), and have one front seat for the driver, and space enough for two adults in the rear passenger seat. Most will also have a small space behind the passenger seat to place goods or bags. 
 
 These things can, and often do, go through almost every type of terrain and weather day after day. If you're backpacking around Sri Lanka, Tuk Tuk's will most likely be your lifeline getting to small remote places that you will want to see, or even longer distances.

 **How to get one**: Getting a Tuk Tuk is probably the easiest thing you can do. As a foreign traveler you are (for better or worse) a walking advertisement of cash. Simply walk along the street, there's a high chance a local will ask if you want to rent their Tuk Tuk. 

 **Cost**: Sri Lankan's are a helpful and positive people. However, there are always bad actors looking to take advantage of an opportune moment. Here are some things to watch out for... 
 
 
 - If you're recognized as a foreigner, it's very likely some Tuk Tuk drivers will attempt to overcharge you (relative to the cost of what they'd charge a local). Understand that while this seems unfair, locals see you as someone who is coming from a more economically stable (and profitable) country who can afford higher prices. Do your research beforehand on how much a journey will cost to see if (and by how much) they might be overcharging you. Ask you hostel / hotel on what the rate should be for the distance. I'd generally not recommend trying to haggle over 300 LKR around the going rate, this basically amounts to 1 EUR.

 - Drivers will sometimes ask if it's your first time in Sri Lanka, and also how long you have been there. While this is sometimes open and honest conversation, it's also good social engineering and a means to understand your level of local knowledge. If you say its your first time, some drivers might ask if you'd like to drive the Tuk Tuk to have a fun experience. This is indeed fun, but it's also a tactic for them to build trust. The driver will likely then say they can drive you everywhere you'd like to go for a *great* price. Sharing such an experience is a good way for them build a rapport and make you less likely to question it them overcharging. This indeed happened to us, and we subsequently found out the driver grossly overcharged us on our initial journey.  

 <details>
    <summary>
    **More Info:** Useful Apps
    </summary>

 If you want to test what a price might be, you can download the PickMe Sri Lanka App. This is basically an √ºber service for Sri Lanka. However, many locals refuse to accept journeys because PickMe takes 20\% commission for smaller vehicles (i.e., Tuk Tuk's). So, while a Tuk Tuk is normally the cheapest option, the driver will earn even less due to the companies commission. The commission rate reduced with larger vehicles that can take more passengers. 

 Nevertheless, the App is still good for looking at a ''standard'' rate. You can then use that a point of negotiation.  

 </details>



### Car

For longer journeys or if you're a larger group, traveling by car might be the best option - for price and speed. If you've not got long to travel (e.g., < 2 weeks), you won't have the luxury of spending a whole day for low-cost public services to travel from place to place. If you're doing this multiple times, this can quickly eat into actual sightseeing goals. 

Compared to Tuk Tuk's, the cost of a car taxi service is not so competitive. This is because chances are, you're traveling longer distances and they will get a reasonable amount of money regardless, and the higher cost will be cheaper in the long run for more people.

The PickMe app can be used to find local taxis, or better, ask your hostel or hotel for local services. These are likely friends or family.

### Bus

Busses in Sri Lanka are on another level. These machines are king of the road, and make zero compromises on speed, road space, decorations, and number of passengers. My recommendation is, if you can, make all long distance journeys using the bus, or even for shorter trips if you're going along a main road.


    
### Train

During our trip we took the train two times. One for the train ride from Kandy to Ella, and the second tome travelling up the west coast back to Colombo from the south.

## Locations

### Dambulla

#### Travel

Traveling to Dambulla From Colombo, we initially took a Tuk Tuk from our accommodation to Negombo, where we then got the bus to Dambulla. 

The bus connection was **No. 34** Dambulla Station ‚Üí Kurunegala Station, and the change to **No. 48** Kurunegala Station ‚Üí Dambulla Station. Then from Dambulla bus station we took a Tuk Tuk to our accommodation.

#### Accommodation

Our accommodation in Dambulla was a homestay roughly 21 km south of the main city. We wanted somewhere with a bit more of a rural feel to see some of the locals, as there is no shortage of busy city streets. 

The __[Blue Mountains View](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12897977-d12605839-Reviews-Blue_Mountains_View-Lenadora_Central_Province.html)__ homestay, located in "The Village" (referred to by the locals) is part of a farm that grows a variety of fruit and vegetables for the local community. The host, Pradeep, runs the tourist side of the business together with his father who run the majority of the farming. His mother is the heart of the gastronomy, where you'll get to experience some locally cooked food home grown from the farm. 

On the morning of after our first night Pradeep gave us a tour of the farm showing all the local goods that are grown, including a very large banana farm, tomato's, coconuts, spices, etc. The tour really was a highlight of this trip, and the rooms, and facilities were also nicely kept. If you wanted to eat at the homestay, various group seatings are available in the main kitchen or near your rooms. These spots are great for soaking in the atmosphere, and wildlife around the farm.

### Kandy

#### Travel

Traveling from Dambulla to Kandy was fairly easy, most of the busses that travel south go to kandy. We got on a bus along the "Kandy Highway" Rd. 

The bus takes you to the main bus stop where, after walking around for a bit, we got a Tuk Tuk to our accommodation to drop off our bags. 

#### Accommodation

We spent two nights in Kandy at __[The Bunkalow](https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/bunkalow.en-gb.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaDuIAQGYAQm4AQfIAQ_YAQHoAQH4AQyIAgGoAgO4Aq3Al8AGwAIB0gIkM2E0MzNlYWQtOTFkYS00ZmIwLTk2ZGYtMzJmYWI3YmYzMTc42AIG4AIB&sid=3ab5d8fa2c9ddbec98adece6b031ac62&dist=0&group_adults=2&group_children=0&hapos=1&hpos=1&no_rooms=1&req_adults=2&req_children=0&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&sr_order=distance_from_search&srepoch=1745215556&srpvid=f3a32adf821a01a1&type=total&ucfs=1&)__. The room we booked was a private double bedroom, but there are hostel-style bunk rooms for those looking to save. The location is a bit further out from the city center next to the river, which offers a bit of peace and quiet after the hustle and bustle of the city.

### Kandy ‚Üí Ella Train

:::tip Train Info

Although not a location itself, the train ride from Kandy to Ella deserves it's own section, simply to have all the information in one place. Here's a complete breakdown of all details for the journey and my two-cents on the experience. 

:::

#### Train Details

- **Tickets**: You *can* reserve tickets for the train journey. However, depending on what experience you want to have, it might not be needed. 
- **I don't have tickets**: You can buy tickets on the day from **1 hour** before the train arrives. Go to the ticket stands 1.5h or even 2h before your train arrives and get ready to do some queuing. They will only be selling 2nd Class or 3rd Class tickets, probably without seats.
- **Platform**: If you're departing from Kandy, the train will depart from both platforms 1 and 2. You can board the train from both sides. 
- **Carriages / Class**: 
- **Locals**: You are a guest in this country so please have respect for the locals on the train. People use this train for the reason it's there, and not as a tourist attraction.

#### The Experience

It's true, this one of the most scenic train journeys you will possibly experience. The views outside of the tea fields rolling over the mountains is spectacular. However, Instagram and influencer culture has unfortunately saturated the space with people wanting to get the same picture hanging out the door to get a picture. As a result the process can feel so contrived and fake, particularly if you ARE looking to enjoy the view and the experience.

### Ella 

#### Arrival 

From Ella train station we took a taxi (using the PickMe app) to drive to our accommodation in the mountains. 

#### Accommodation

Our hotel was called [__Glorious Nature Inn__](https://www.booking.com/Share-TGKjSA), where we stayed for two nights. Like in Dambulla, the accommodation was one of the highlights of the time in Ella, with a room that overlooked the sunrise coming over the mountains in the morning. All the accommodation that you can find along Kitalella Rd will have a similar view if you're far up the mountain enough.

### Udawalawae

#### Arrival 

Udawalawae is much more remote than the other locations so getting there requires either more time, or more cash. The owners of our accommodation in Ella had a friend who was a taxi driver so we decided to use him to save on time. Along the way we stopped off at [__Ravana__](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616035-d2255787-Reviews-Ravana_Ella_Falls-Ella_Uva_Province.html) waterfall, "[__Secret__](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616035-d27428400-Reviews-Ella_Secret_Falls_View-Ella_Uva_Province.html?m=69573)" waterfall, and some king coconuts for a refresher after some climbing. Overall the journay was about 10,000 LKR (approx. 30 EUR) - including the king coconuts.  

#### Accommodation

We stayed for two nights at [__Walawa Reach Hotel__](https://www.booking.com/Share-lp18Cf). While the accommodation was nice, there's really only need to stay one night here. If you've booked a sunrise safari, then after you're back at the hostel/hotel in the afternoon you can move on to your next location.

### South Coast

#### Arrival

From Udawalawae to our accommodation in Weligama we took a taxi once again, as the buss from Udawalawae didn't seem to come so often, and the travel would take too long otherwise. The rest of the journey from the south cost, up along the coastline all the way back up to the airport we took the bus.     

#### Accommodation 

We spent a week along the coast, split between the south coast staying at [__Lucky Surf Camp__](https://www.booking.com/Share-Uytt2p), and the [__Hummus Hostel__](https://www.booking.com/Share-9qsVWZG) in Hikkaduwa more on the east side. Both places were great, but Lucky's Surf Camp was
